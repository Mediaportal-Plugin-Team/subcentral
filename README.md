## SubCentral

**SubCentral** is a standalone subtitles plugin for the MediaPortal HTPC application. The purpose of the plugin is to allow user to search and download subtitles for movies or TV shows managed by popular Moving Pictures and MP-TVSeries plugins. It also has the interfaces to allow easy implementation and integration in any other plugin.

Best way to use SubCentral is through one of the supported plugins. If you wish, there is a possibility to modify search data SubCentral grabs from the plugins for more customized search. If plugin is opened from home screen, only manual search is possible, where you can create your own search queries for movies or TV shows.

Before using SubCentral for the first time, use MediaPortal configuration to configure the plugin thoroughly (selecting, reordering and renaming groups/providers, selecting and ordering languages and managing of the download folders).

From the GUI you can enable/disable languages (but not language priority), search, download or delete existing subtitles and sort the search results using different criteria, including unique **tag ranking** system.
